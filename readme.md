#Data structure/ algorithm project.

For the final individual assignment I chose to create a page that demonstrates the insert-sort method. The page allows you to inerractively create an array of random numbers that are stored as a new `<li>` in the DOM. When the 'sort' button is pressed. It will sort the list of numbers, starting at the index of 1, and comparing it to the number before it. If the number before it is larger, then it will insert before it. If the number is equal or smaller, then it will not move any more, and the next index will be checked. This continues down the line untill all numbers are sorted.
